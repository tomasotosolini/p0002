= StHtml

==Introduction

Developers often are required to present *forms* to thier users and gather
informations users reply. If you are a ruby web developer this gem may be useful
since aims to make this things more easy, keeping you away from html forms and
parameter handling noise.

==Example

The form with login, full user name, address stuff, password (with confirm) to 
be presented in your amazing brand new social web portal. Once user has 
submitted her values you should gather the collected info, the you'd like to 
validate them in order to prevent missing or wrong fields. Next it would be nice 
to present a report with the saved values (not the passwords though), with 
additional info about the pin and the supplementary passfrase.

So at a glance with StHtml you can do this quite easily, we hope.

Create a Form object

register_form = Form.new

add it with the fields:

login = register_form.add( "string", "login" ) 
register_form.add( "string", "full_name" ) 
register_form.add( "text", "address" ) 
register_form.add( "password", "pass" ) 
register_form.add( "password", "passc" ) 


add validation stuff:

login.validators << NotNullValidator
register_form.validators << FieldsEqual.new "pass", "passc" 


Next when you want to show this form:

register_form.render

Once user posts her new data

register_form.load

to validate:

register_form.validate

to show the report:

register_form.render_
